# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Prediction Diabetes and Kidney Diseases for MADE project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How can we predict diabetes and kidney disease and is there a commonality between them?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

 Diabetes and chronic kidney disease are two serious diseases that can cause death. In this project we use two separate datasets to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has these diseases. 
 Our goal is to analyze each of these datasets to understand what factors influence the prediction , as well as whether there is a relationship between these diseases.


## Datasources


<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset


* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data?select=diabetes.csv
* Data Type: CSV
* Description: The objective of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on  certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

### Datasource2: Chronic_Kidney_Disease 


* Metadata URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/336/chronic+kidney+disease
* Data URL: https://github.com/aiplanethub/Datasets/blob/master/Chronic%20Kidney%20Disease%20(CKD)%20Dataset/ChronicKidneyDisease.csv
* Data Type: CSV
* Description: This dataset can be used to predict the chronic kidney disease and it can be collected from the hospital nearly 2 months of period.
