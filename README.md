# Data Analysis of Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease

## Project Overview

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease are formidable health challenges that pose significant threats to individuals' well-being, often leading to severe complications and, in extreme cases, mortality. Recognizing the critical need for early detection and diagnosis, this project endeavors to employ predictive modeling techniques on two distinct datasets to understand the factors influencing the development of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Additionally, the project aims to explore whether there is a relationship between these two diseases.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Data engineering and analysis of diabetes dataset and creating a predictive model for that. 
- Data engineering and analysis of chronic kidney disease dataset and creating a predictive model for that.
- Explore potential relationships between diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

## Datasets

The analysis will be conducted using two distinct datasets:

1. [Diabetes Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npradaschnor/Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Dataset/master/diabetes.csv): This dataset contains information relevant to diabetes.
2. [Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiplanethub/Datasets/master/Chronic%20Kidney%20Disease%20(CKD)%20Dataset/ChronicKidneyDisease.csv): This dataset contains information relevant to chronic kidney disease.

## Methodology

In this project we employed Machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis to analyze the datasets and draw insights into the factors influencing diabetes and chronic kidney disease.
